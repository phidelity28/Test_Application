First Repo
Create a project/repo in GitHub called Test Application.

SSH to your Virtual Server.
Create the two files below using command line(create a directory first):
index.html
git.MD
Add these files to your repo and commit them with the message: "files added".
Push this repo to GitHub.
Create a Hello World message inside your index.html file. Then add, commit, and push those changes.
Create a basic syntax guide using Markdown for the following Git commands, describing what each command does:
git init
git add
git commit
Add the following notes to your syntax guide:
git clone means you are making a copy of the repository on your system.
git fork means you are copying the repository to your GitHub account.
git pull means you are fetching the last modified repository.
git push means you are returning the repository after modifying it.
git clone is downloading and git pull is refreshing.
